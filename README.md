## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- @media query for responsiveness


### What I learned

I learned how pages are structured responsively using the @media Query rule. I also learned how to centered the whole page using the code snippet below. Although it disrupted th mobile layout so I didnt use it.

```css
html, Body {
  widths: 100%;
}
html{
    display: table;
    margin: auto;
}
body{
    display: table-cell;
    vertical-align: middle;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to perfect my learning on the Grid layout system. I also want to expand my knowledge on creating responsive websites using mobile-first approach of course, and work on a bigger and complex project than this.


### Useful resources
